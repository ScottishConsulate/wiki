# Audio

Part of the consulate's charm is our wide range of musical tastes. We'll listen to, play and enjoy everything from bagpipes to gabba depending on the event.

To this end, we want to expand our collection of music and playlists to a better defined range that reflects our collective interests. I (hibby) would also really like to have a network share to pull from, and to share our culture and music across the whole event.

## Hardware

  * Sketchy Sony Stereo, as seen at CCC2015 as our core sound system. This accepts phono, CDs and Cassette Tapes.
  * WD Network HDD Enclosure (can probably be filled with 2 TB HDD too)
