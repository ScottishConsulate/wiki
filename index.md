# Scottish Consulate

## Introduction

Hello! Welcome to the Scottish Consulate! You've appeared here either through curiosity or you've clicked a link.

## Who are the Scottish Consulate?

We're a hacker collective from Scotland who represent ourselves and our country at events round the world!

We aim to provide a chilled out, primarily social space in the mania of hacker camps and conferences for people to visit, stay, contribute to and share.

We run Scottish themed events in partnerships with other villages / assemblies we're friends with - whisky tastings, food nights, etc. 

## How do I join?

Just rock up! You don't have to be Scottish to be a member, we run an Asylum program for our international friends! Add your name to our event page wiki and you are welcome to camp with/socialise with/party with us to your heart's content!
